  ## You are not required to follow orders which are extremely unreasonable

  Any order which is a violation of a core rule cannot be followed.

  Some orders are extremely unreasonable or obnoxious, such as "do nothing but collect every piece of trash on the station" or "never stop moving". These orders can be ignored and ahelped.

  Some orders violate a roleplay rule. These orders must be followed if your laws require it. You are not breaking a rule by following a law that causes you to violate roleplay rules. If someone takes advantage of a law to cause you to do something that they would not be allowed to do because of roleplay rules, then they are the ones responsible for the rule violation.
